# H<sub>2</sub> + H

This example shows how to perform a nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation for a reaction path search.

We consider a reaction: H<sub>2</sub> + H &rarr H + H<sub>2</sub>.

## Calculation of the initial and final states

In a NEB calculation, initial and final state structures should be determined first.
To save time, these structures and corresponding input files are stored in ``Initial`` and ``Final`` directories.
