# H_2 + H

This example shows how to perform a nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation for a reaction path search.

We consider a reaction: H_2 + H --> H + H__2.

## Calculation of the initial and final states

In a NEB calculation, initial and final state structures should be determined first.
To save time, these structures and corresponding input files are stored in ``Initial`` and ``Final`` directories.
